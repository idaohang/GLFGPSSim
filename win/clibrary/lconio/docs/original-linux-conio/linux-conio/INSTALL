ATTENTION:
If you have problems compiling this version. Try Linux-conio version 1.00.
If the problem persists check your ncurses installation. If it still persists
write a bug report. If it then still persists - write a bug fix. If you cannot
write a bug fix take a gun and shoot yourself.... ;)

However it is not always neccessary to compile. If you have problems just use the precompiled version.

Please read the file README for information on how to install and use the linux-conio.
